# Database-Editor-Series
Repo for storing all projects in relation to my Database Editors. All versions from v1.0 are stored here.

Hello, and welcome to my repo! This project is just something I started on a random day and kept working on as time passed, so it's just me working on this code.

The Database Editor is (at the moment) a terminal + text-based app that allows you to manipulate a set of data in a list in many ways. It's the perfect way to easily store values on your computer without the need to have a proper app open, and can do most of the basic functions that a proper database app would let you do.

If you'd like to see what's been happening with this project over time as well as what I have planned for the future, go ahead and read the 'CURRENTPATCHNOTES' file.

Thanks for checking out my program!
