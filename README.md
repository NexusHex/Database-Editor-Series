# Database-Editor-Series
Repo for storing all projects in relation to my Database Editors. All versions from v1.0 are stored here.

The Database Editor is a terminal + text-based app that allows you to manipulate a set of data in a list in many ways. It's the perfect way to easily store values on your computer without the need to have a proper app open, and can do most of the basic functions that a proper database app would let you do. I also have created a Text-to-Speech version of the program to broaden my horizons into accessible applications, so be sure to check that one out.

This project is now finished, and all versions have been bug-tested and posted here, as well as in my Pastebin (https://pastebin.com/u/-_Nexus_-) and my Replit (https://replit.com/@PrimalHex). Feel free to explore my code to your heart's content!
