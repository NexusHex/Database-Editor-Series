This version added file-interaction capabilities, so you now have to keep the main file and the .txt file in the same folder. One addition was made this patch:
> User can save list 'data' to file 'databases.txt' (multiple saves are possible)

To run this code, please copy all of the folder's contents, make sure that the .txt file is in the same area as the main file, and run the program in a proper Python interpreter/editor like IDLE, VSCode or Anaconda
