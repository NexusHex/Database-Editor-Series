I got the inspiration to add animations to the Editor when I was reading a book on coding with Python that I got from the library. I saw code for a loading bar animation and a rotating cube, so I suddenly decided to add those animations to my code on impulse, since they were so nice. Don't worry, I've credited the author of the book in all my code from here onwards
